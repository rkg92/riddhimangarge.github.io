I am a Washington Research Foundation Fellow in the Department of [Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu/) and [Brotman Baty Insititute](https://brotmanbaty.org/) at the University of Washington. 

My research interests lie at the interface of systems, synthetic, developmental biology. My research leverages both experimental and computational â€˜omics-based methods to better understand how genes and the regulatory networks they constitute are functionally conserved, organized, and regulated across a variety of biological processes including cell differentiation and development. These topics fit into my long-term research goal of understanding the functions and organization of human genes, a major portion of which remain uncharacterized thereby paving new paths to decipher the basis of human disease.
